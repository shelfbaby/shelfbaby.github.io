The max number of tickets will vary depending on the number of other channels you already have on your server.\nDiscord also limits the number of channels per category to 50.

The ‘Create’ category is where new tickets are created, the ‘Claim’ category is where tickets claimed by individuals having the Ticket Manager Roles are moved, and the ‘Close’ category is where the resolved tickets are relocated.

Claiming moves the ticket to the ‘Claim’ category you defined during panel setup, so it will unclutter the ‘Create’ category. Also if you work in a team, claiming a ticket will add the name of the claimer on the ticket. This helps clarify who’s handling which tickets.","plugins.ticketing.faq.question9":"I can’t claim or close a ticket any longer, why?","plugins.ticketing.faq.answer9":"Discord limits the number of channels per category to 50.

Its content will still be accessible.\nDeleting a ticket will permanently delete it. It will stop counting in the global server limit of 500 channels and 50 channels per category, and its content won’t be accessible any longer. We are generating transcripts so that content is never lost.","plugins.ticketing.faq.question11":"What are the 4 buttons that are pinned to each ticket: Claim, Close, Reopen, and Delete?","plugins.ticketing.faq.answer11":"Claim allows you to move a new ticket to a given category and to rename it with the name of the claimer.\nClose allows you to close a ticket without losing its content.\nReopen is clickable as soon as a ticket is closed. Clicking it reopens the ticket.\nDelete allows you to permanently delete a ticket. The channel assigned to the ticket will be deleted and it will not be possible to restore it.
